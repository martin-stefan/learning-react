Notes

redux helps to control the state of an app

state is the life of the app and determines how it acts

sometimes a certain state is needed on mulitple components and is difficult to share 

What does redux do?
 - each redux has a central store which sotres the entire apps state
 - sets a defined way to change state

creates subscriptions to keep track of components and when they change state
